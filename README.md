CogniTranslate 🤖✨
The soul of translation.
CogniTranslate is a modern, feature-rich translation service powered by Google's Gemini generative AI. It was built to demonstrate the practical application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in creating intelligent, beautiful, and user-friendly tools. The application features a stunning, animated user interface and a suite of advanced functionalities that go far beyond basic translation.

✨ Features
CogniTranslate is packed with advanced features designed for a seamless and intuitive user experience:-

🧠 AI-Powered Translations: Leverages the Gemini 1.5 Flash model for high-quality, nuanced translations that understand context and tone.

🎙️ Voice-to-Text Input: Speak directly into the app using the integrated Web Speech API. The microphone button provides clear visual feedback when listening.

🔍 Automatic Language Detection: No need to specify the source language. The application intelligently detects the input language and translates from it automatically.

📜 Translation History: Your five most recent translations are saved to your session and displayed in a clean history list for easy reference.

📋 Copy to Clipboard: A convenient one-click button to copy the translated text, with a tooltip for confirmation.

🎨 Animated & Responsive UI: A beautiful, "living" interface with a gently shifting gradient background, floating shapes for depth, and smooth, fluid animations on all interactive elements.

⚙️ Dynamic & Scalable: The language lists are dynamically populated from the backend, making it easy to add more languages in the future.

🛠️ Technology Stack
The project is built with a modern, robust technology stack:

Backend: Python 3, Flask (for routing and session management).

Frontend: HTML5, JavaScript, Custom CSS (for advanced animations and styling).

AI Service: Google Gemini API.
